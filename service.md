## Community Service

At UC Berkeley I serve as a student representative on the Math Department's [Equity and Inclusion Committee](https://math.berkeley.edu/resources/equity-inclusion-and-diversity) and in Spring 2021 I have been working as a Graduate Assembly [Department Climate Advocate](https://www.ga.berkeley.edu/about/open-positions/) for the math department.
I am also an officer of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association (MGSA) and previously served on Unbounded Representation (URep), student groups which organize
student events from office draw, picnics, weekly teas, movie nights, and more! I am also part of [Noetherian Ring](https://nring.math.berkeley.edu/) a network
of academics who identify with gender minorities in math at UC Berkeley.

During my time at Williams College I served as an officer and president of the Student Math and Stat Advisory Board ([SMASAB](https://math.williams.edu/majors/smasab/))
for three years organizing student events and feedback. Through SMASAB, I helped start a peer mentorship program for
potential and recently declared math and stat majors in the department. For two of those years I also served as officer and then
co-chair of the Association for Women in Math chapter organizing social and academic events for women interested in math.
I also served on the Computer Science Student  Activities/Advisory Committee ([CoSSAC](https://csci.williams.edu/people/students/cossac-computer-science-student-advisory-committee/)) for a year.

## Mentorship and Outreach

<!-- started and served as a mentor for the grad student peer mentor program  -->

**Peer Mentor Program at UC Berkeley**

As part of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association, I helped create a peer mentorship program for first year graduate students in the math department at UC Berkeley and have been serving as a peer mentor myself since Fall 2020.  

**Science Fair Judging**

As an alumn of science fairs such as International Science and Engineering Fair ([ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/)),
 Science Talent Search ([STS](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/)),
 and the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium ([JSHS](https://www.jshs.org/)), I know the value of encouraging young students
interested in STEM and research. To play a part encouraging the next generation of researchers, I
have volunteered in judging regional science fairs such as [Sciencepalooza](https://outreach-foundation.org/programs/sciencepalooza/). 
<!-- add VA state science fair here too -->

**Directed Reading Program**

In my first year at Berkeley I volunteered for the [Directed Reading Program](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/) as a mentor.
My student read about Modular Forms (Diamond and Shurman) and Algebraic Number
Theory (Neukirch).
