# Jekyll and Hyde 

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), speifically modified from the [Hyde](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde) template. 

# Directory Layout 

**Pages** for the webiste correspond to `.md` files in the main directory. 

**Files** such as pdfs and photos are stored in the `assets` folder. The subfolder `assets/photos` holds pictures for the 'Personal' page.

**Page Layouts** as `html` files are stored in the `_layouts` folder. These control how the markdown gets loaded into the overall page. 

**Page Components** such as the photo image sliders are stored in the `_includes` directory. 

**Photo Lists/Captions** for the personal page are stored in `_data/sliders.yml`.
