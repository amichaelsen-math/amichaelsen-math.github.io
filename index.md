I am a third year graduate student in mathematics at UC Berkeley advised by [Melanie Wood](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mmwood/).
For undergrad I attended Williams College where I completed my [thesis](/research) with Susan Loepp.
My research interests are in (algebraic) number theory.


My CV can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf). You can also view courses I have taught or am teaching
[here](/teaching) and my publications are listed [here](/research). You can find other writing
I've done [here](/articles).

I have also written up information about my experience with the UC Berkeley Qualifying Exam in mathematics [here](/quals), including my quals [syllabus](/assets/quals/quals syllabus.pdf), a [transcript](/assets/quals/quals transcript.pdf) of my exam, some [advice](/assets/quals/quals advice.pdf) on preparing, and my sample study materials.
